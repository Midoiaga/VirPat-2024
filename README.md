## Introduction

Virtual patients (VPs) have emerged as potent educational tools in medical training and healthcare simulation. They offer medical students the opportunity to simulate authentic clinical consultations, allowing them to practice a wide range of scenarios and gain valuable experience before engaging with real patients during medical exams or interviews. These VPs are built upon dialogue systems, which are automated AI systems designed to interact with users through natural language conversations. The primary objective of a dialogue system is to facilitate effective communication between humans and computers, comprehend user input in the form of text or speech, and provide appropriate responses to user queries.

To realize this objective, we have developed two medical domain corpora: a corpus containing manually aligned doctor questions, patient responses, and corresponding clinical histories in spanish [(VIR-PAT-QA corpus)](#QA), and a corpus of medical dialogue questions in Spanish annotated with intentions (Intent corpus)(#Intent). Additionally, to demonstrate the utility of these corpora, we have developed two models: a Question-Answer system ([QA model](https://huggingface.co/Mikelium5/VIR-PAT-QA/) and [Code](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/legacy/question-answering/run_squad.py) to experiment with) and an intent classification system ([Intent classifier model](https://huggingface.co/Mikelium5/DoctorIntentClassifier) and [Code](https://github.com/Midoiaga/VirPat-2024/blob/main/ClinicalIntentClassification(Vir-Pat).ipynb) use to create it). These models aim to enhance medical training and education by enabling effective communication and interaction between medical professionals and AI systems.


## VIR-PAT-QA corpus
<a id="QA"></a>


The goal of the VIR-PAT-QA corpus is to align each dialogue with a corresponding clinical record in natural language, thereby enhancing the dialogue dataset with textual descriptions of each patient. This approach paves the way for the creation of new virtual patients by simply adding new clinical records to the dataset. To achieve this objective, we initially translated doctor-patient consultation dialogues from English to Spanish, which were recorded following the format of the OSCE exams and subsequently transcribed by [(Fareez et al. (2022))](#Fareez). Following translation, we manually corrected any errors in the translations. Subsequently, we created clinical records based on the doctor-patient dialogues. Finally, we associated each patient's answer with the clinical report in which it was given.

The ultimate dataset comprises 6,290 question-answer pairs derived from 129 distinct clinical cases, formatted according to the SQuAD v2.0 format proposed by Rajpurkar et al. (2016) with JSON structure. The dataset was partitioned into training, development, and test sets, constituting 75%, 10%, and 15% of the corpus, respectively. Within this dataset, three types of questions are present:

  - Questions that need to be answered: questions that require seeking the answer in the reports.
    
      * Answered questions: the response appears in the report

      * Unanswered questions: They refer to instances where the required information to formulate a response is absent in the clinical report. In the dataset, these instances are characterized by an empty span and the "is_impossible" attribute set to True. Such questions may arise when the patient fails to comprehend the inquiry or when the provided answer in the dialogue does not adequately address the question. Consequently, the "answer" section in the dataset remains empty for these instances.

  - Questions that do not need and answer pertain to instances where an answer is not required, typically occurring when a medical student or doctor makes a comment rather than solicits information. These comments might include expressions like "Thank you" or "OK," or statements indicating the next course of action, such as "Now I will check your temperature." Detecting and understanding these types of utterances is crucial, as a standard question-answering system might erroneously attempt to generate responses for each question posed, which is inappropriate for these types of statements. In the dataset, such instances are denoted by an "I" in the "answer" section, serving as a distinguishing marker from other question types.


In the following table you can find the distribution of each type of question:

| Question type                       | train | dev | test |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------|---------------|
| Questions that need to be answered           | 4573           | 496          | 915           |
  |             - Answered questions   | 2753           | 295          | 580           |
|               - Unanswered questions | 1820           | 201          | 335           |
| Questions that do not have to be answered    | 228            | 27           | 51            |
| **Total**                               | 4801  | 523 | 966  |


The corpus consists of several attributes: Beginning with the "data" section, it contains all the information regarding clinical reports, questions, and answers. Moving on to the "paragraphs" section, we encounter the clinical report, along with the associated questions and answers for a specific patient. Within this section, the "context" refers to the clinical report itself, while the "qas" section contains details regarding the questions and answers. From the questions, we extract the question text ("question"), an identifier ("id"), and a flag indicating whether the question can be answered based on the context ("is_impossible"). The "answer" element includes the actual text of the answer ("text") and the starting position of the answer within the context ("answer_start"). Lastly, there is a less relevant attribute known as the document ID or title ("title"), which is not utilized by the model.


Moreover, the QA corpus also contains different question formats: the one that has the only the question itself, other one with the question and the intention (intent) of the doctor together and the last one that only has the intention of the doctor.




##  Intent corpus
<a id="Intent"></a>


This corpus is adapted from a French corpus described in the "A French Medical Conversations Corpus Annotated for a Virtual Patient Dialogue System" paper by [(Laleye et al. (2020))](#Laleye). Initially in French, it underwent automatic translation to Spanish and subsequent manual correction, resulting in 2691 utterances. Among these, 145 distinct intent types were identified, with 11 categorized as main categories. The intents were hierarchically organized, spanning up to four levels of subcategories, including the main category.

The dataset is stratified into three sets: 80% for training (2079 utterances), and 10% each for development and testing (306 utterances each). In CSV format, the dataset's columns include the doctor's utterance ("texto"), the main intention of the doctor ("categoria_general"), followed by sub-intents up to "intent_3", and finally, the last column ("intent_4") represents the final intent for each utterance.


The following tables explains each intent with a descrition, example and amount:
